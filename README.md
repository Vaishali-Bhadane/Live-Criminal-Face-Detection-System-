# Live Criminal Face Detection System

This project aims to develop a real-time criminal face detection system using Python. The system leverages OpenCV's Haar Cascade algorithm to detect faces in video feeds from a camera. The project is divided into three main modules:

### 1. **Face Dataset Module**
In this module, faces are fed into the model using **OpenCV** (`cv2`) and **OS** modules. The dataset is curated by collecting images for model training.

### 2. **Training Module**
This module trains the face detection model. Using libraries like:
- `cv2` for computer vision tasks.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image manipulation.

The model is trained on the dataset to recognize faces accurately.

### 3. **Face Detection Module**
The final module implements real-time face detection. Using the trained model and **cv2**, the system detects faces from live video streams, identifying faces instantly in front of the camera.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **PIL (Pillow)**
